# üìù Introduction
Maintaining a healthy body starts with eating nutritious food. However, achieving this goal is often more challenging than it seems. It's not just about eating healthy, we must also consider various factors, such as the nutritional value of the food, how to prepare it in a way that retains its nutrients, and how to make it taste delicious. These considerations can be overwhelming for many people, especially when they are unsure where to start.

To address this challenge, we created NYAM, which stands for Not Your Average Menu. NYAM is an innovative Android application designed to help users find healthy diet menus based on the ingredients they already have at home. It is also save and track user daily-needs nutrition. The app uses image recognition technology to analyze an image of the ingredients uploaded by the user. It then predicts the content of the image and suggests recipes tailored to the user's BMI, making healthy eating more accessible and personalized than ever before.

This project is organized into three major categories, each representing a core aspect of our work. We will provide a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities and tasks associated with each category, offering insights into the specific job roles and contributions involved. The categories are outlined as follows:

## ü§ñ Machine Learning
